## Initial setup
When first launching **Shadow of the Colossus BINGO!** you must introduce target times for each colossus, in each difficulty in the _Set Times_ menu. This will serve as a baseline for the bingo tile times.

It is recommended that the times should be your best times you can get within the timeframe you wish to play for (just don't put times that you took dozens of hours getting unless you want to play bingo for dozen of hours).

Once the times have been added, press the _Set Times_ button to save. Keep in mind all times must follow this format: X:YY.zz or YY.zz (X for minutes, Y for seconds, z for miliseconds). If you wish to revert to the last times you have saved, press the _Reset Times_ button. If you wish to delete your times, press the _Delete Times_ button (Careful! There is no safeguard as of now).

Back in the main menu, you can input the background colour if you so wish (recommended for chroma keying). It must be a 6 digit hex value without the # at the beginning.

## How to play
Once you generate your board, 25 random cells will appear in a 5x5 grid. These will indicate what colossus you must defeat and in which difficulty you must do so, aswell as a target time to beat. Once you've performed a run faster than said target time, you may click on the cell to mark is as completed. The percentage number is the _Offset_, which is the extra time the target has compared to the baseline time.

When you have 5 completed cells in a row, that's BINGO!

### How to exit the game
